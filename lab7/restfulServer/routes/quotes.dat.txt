Whatever you are, be a good one.
If you dream it, you can do it.
Every moment is a fresh beginning.
Never, never, never give up.
Don’t wait. The time will never be just right.
If not us, who? If not now, when?
Turn your wounds into wisdom.
Wherever you go, go with all your heart.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
Hope is a waking dream.
Action is the foundational key to all success.
Do one thing every day that scares you.
You must do the thing you think you cannot do.
Life is trying things to see if they work.
Don’t regret the past, just learn from it.
Believe you can and you’re halfway there.
The power of imagination makes us infinite.
Live what you love.
Eighty percent of success is showing up.
To be the best, you must be able to handle the worst.
A jug fills drop by drop.
The obstacle is the path.
If you have never failed you have never lived.
Hope is the heartbeat of the soul.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
It is never too late to be what you might have been.
We become what we think about.
An obstacle is often a stepping stone.
Dream big and dare to fail.
Men are born to succeed, not fail.
